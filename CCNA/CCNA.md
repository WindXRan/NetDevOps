## Network devices

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model was developed as a way to help disparate computing systems communicate with each other.

> Most devices do function at more than one level of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) reference model.When it comes time to determine the highest level at which they operate.To do that,you must know what they do and how that relates to the OSI model.

## Layer 1 devices

Introduction to network devices I.

#### Analog modem

1. The word modem is actually derived from a contraction of modulator/demodulator.
   - Modems were developed to take the digital signal coming from a digital node and conver it to an analog signal (modulating the signal) to be  placed on the wire.In return, it would accept an analog singal from the wire and convert it (demodulating the signal) to a digital signal that the node could understand.



2. they were developed to create connections between network segements via the public switched telephone network (PSTN) using the plain old telephone system (POTS).
   - Modems provide for a single connection to a network.

#### Hub

1. A hub functions as a concentrator/repeater in that it doesn't care where the signal comes from or where it is going.
   - It takes the electrical signal that arrives on a port and replicates that signal out all of the other ports.



2. A hub may have just a few ports,or it may have many ports.

   - For a variety of reasons,the hub is not very common in modern networking.
